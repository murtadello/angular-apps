        <h1>Murtaza Mohammadi</h1>
        <p>
            I've been working with Murtaza for a year now in a coaching relationship
            with the Powercoders program. I know him as a friendly, team-player who is
            willing to take on new challenges and take a step out of his comfort zone.
            He is also helping other participants in the Powercoders program to learn
            more about testing and other skills. Through all the incredible
            challenges, that he had to face this year, he kept a positive outlook and
            pushed on to learn new skills and try new ways to move ahead. His most
            important strengths are his skill to learn new things, openness, humor,
            connection with people, and language skills (great German and English).
            His personality shaped a lot and I must say that he became more confident,
            he became better at expressing himself and to learn from his mistakes.
            Regardless if it's about creating a video CV or creating videos for his
            channel, he is willing to do it in spite of the fears. I definitely
            recommend having a chance to work with him as he brings not just technical
            knowledge, however, a different culture, a different way to solve
            problems. I'm sure diversity leads to stronger, better, and more efficient
            teams.
